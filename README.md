# House-Pricing-Regression-Model
Implementing a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

The **Dataset** consists of various housing parameters like price,area,bedrooms,bathrooms,stories,guestroom,basement,parking,furnishingstatus etc

- **Data Collection:** Importing the dataset using pandas.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Data Visualization:** Using Matplotlib and seaborn we interpret and visualize our dataset.
- **Model Training:** Training the linear regression model on the dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Prediction:** Using the trained model to predict house prices based on input features.
