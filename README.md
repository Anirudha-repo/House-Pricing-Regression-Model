# House-Pricing-Regression-Model
Implementing a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

- The **Dataset** consists of various housing parameters like price,area,bedrooms,bathrooms,stories,guestroom,basement,parking,furnishingstatus etc

The project involves:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset of house prices and their features from sources like real estate websites or public datasets. Ensuring a comprehensive dataset with various housing parameters.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and selecting relevant attributes for the model. Using techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to interpret and visualize the dataset, identifying trends and correlations between features.
- **Model Training**: Training the linear regression model on the dataset, tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance. Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and cross-validation. Analyzing residuals to check for any patterns or biases.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict house prices based on input features, providing a confidence interval for each prediction.

This project leverages linear regression to create an accurate and efficient house price prediction system.
